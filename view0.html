		<p><span class="begin">"I hadn't noticed, </span>but where I found myself was not where I had imagined but where many others had. I had never wished to sit still as I had always found meaning in movement yet I sat in a cubicle repeating every day as I had the last. I had never thought that I would seize to create for my heart lay motionless when it should have been overflowing in music and art. I was once a kid and yet now I stood burried under expectations.</p>
		<p>And so it was to my realization that I could not avoid this path without abandoning the vision of sucess that had been given to me. For the pursuit of these false dreams drew me to this still life; a life I had never wanted.</p>
		<p>For I do not know the road less traveled and so I cannot plant it in my dreams. How am I to dream of something I had never seen.</p>
